        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>
            Developed during Design 170: Visual Expressions, Mori is a graphic design project that explores the emotional resonance of memory through visual storytelling.
        </p>
        <p>
            Inspired by both my own personal writings—poetry and essays—and favorite works by other authors, I transformed these intimate reflections into a series of posters that merge narrative with visual form. Rooted in the course’s emphasis on visual communication across mediums, Mori applies principles of typography, color theory, photography, and grid systems to evoke nostalgia and introspection. Through hands-on branding studies and layout exercises, the project reimagines language as a visual experience, turning quiet moments into expressive works of design.

        <p>
            This collection of posters visually interprets personal poems and favorite prose, blending typography, photography, and layout to evoke memory and emotion. Each piece is designed to stand alone while contributing to a larger narrative of introspection and storytelling.

        <p>
            This section explores the visual identity of Mori, starting with the moodboard that informed the emotional tone of the project. I then crafted a brand profile to guide the visual direction, followed by finalized brand guidelines—including logos, typography, and color palette—that shaped the look and feel of the final deliverables.

        <h1>Concept Design</h1>
        <p>
            For our concept design exploration, we were tasked with creating two distinct visual products that communicated the same story through different mediums. Each design offered a unique interpretation of Mori’s narrative and brand, allowing us to experiment with how storytelling can shift across form and material. The first concept—the Mori Starter Pack—was a DIY-inspired kit that translated the journey of self-discovery into a curated collection of symbolic objects. The second drew inspiration from the immersive packaging of K-pop albums, using tangible objects like photocards, posters, and a concept magazine to embody Mori’s emotional depth and narrative voice. Though stylistically different, both concepts served as physical extensions of Mori.

        <h1>Summary</h1>
        <p>
            The Mori poster project allowed me to explore my personal passions of creative writing and graphic design, while deepening my understanding of visual storytelling. Through this process, I learned how to prototype layouts, design expressive posters, and experiment with zine-making as a medium for narrative. From typography and composition to print-focused details, this project helped me grow as both a designer and storyteller. Moving forward, I hope to expand Mori through additional poster designs, a React-based website experience, and physical prints.
