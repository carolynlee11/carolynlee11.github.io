                    Hi, thanks for stopping by—I'm Carolyn Lee 👋<br><br>
                    I'm a student at Stanford University pursuing my B.S. and M.S in Computer Science, specializing in Human-Computer Interaction!
                    My multidisciplinary background in design and technology allows me to craft solutions that are compassionate—blending empathy, aesthetics, and functionality to create experiences that truly resonate with people.<br><br>

                    When I’m not coding or designing, you can probably find me experimenting with graphic design, writing on my Substack, or finding inspiration in the ordinary.

                <h1>ART.</h1>
                <p>
                    Visual art is a big part of my I enjoy engaging with visual art, especially works from surrealism and impressionism movements.
                    Some of my favorite artists are Monet, Magritte, Hopper, and Morisot.<br><br>
                    Beyond just viewing, I love weaving elements of art into my life and work. From designing interactive experiences 
                    to curating visual narratives, my passion for art influences how I approach storytelling and design.

            <h1>WORK + LEADERSHIP.</h1>
            <p>
                  I’ve been fortunate to grow in fast-paced startup environments and lead design communities that connect students across disciplines. My work sits at the intersection of design and technology, where I translate ideas into interfaces that not only function well but also feel emotionally resonant. At Stanford, I’ve had the opportunity to guide creative teams, host workshops, and mentor peers exploring the intersection of design, storytelling, and engineering. <br><br> Across every role, I strive to design systems and experiences that tell stories, foster connection, and leave lasting impact.

                <p>
                    I’m proficient in both technical and design platforms, bringing together coding and creativity to build engaging experiences. 
                    Whether it’s developing with C++, Python, JavaScript, and Swift, designing with Figma and Photoshop, or crafting interactive UIs with React and TypeScript, 
                    I love bridging technology and design. <br><br>
                    I also have a passion for languages—fluent in English and Chinese, conversant in Cantonese, and always learning more Japanese!

                <p>
                    When I'm not immersed in design or coding, I love finding good eats and cozy cafes to work from, especially around the Bay Area. <br><br> When I'm not out and about, I'm passionate about video games and their narratives—my favorite genres include puzzle and adventure games. My all-time favorites include Professor Layton, Lorelei and the Laser Eyes, Ace Attorney, and Splatoon! <br><br> As of last year, I've started exploring writing as a creative outlet, sharing my thoughts and experiences on my Substack. Bringing creativity into all aspects of my life keeps me motivated and grounded in my identity.
