                    <b>notes:</b> following my 2023 wrapped project, which centered on the idea of monet's impressionist landscapes, i chose to theme my 2024 wrapped in media
                    around the surreal works of rené magritte. magritte's comittment to depicting familiar objects in unfamiliar enviroments resonated with my experience this year—i was 
                    the same familiar self, yet i felt as though each moment was filled with the unexpected. as an individual who seeks to find meaning in everything, this year taught me that sometimes meaning 
                    is found in embracing the ambiguity and beauty of the unknown.

                    <b>notes:</b> during my algorithms class in fall 2024, our professor
                    gave us the chance to make a piece of art based on a concept we learned in class for extra credit. from poems to songs,
                    we were given a chance to create (so long as it remained in the realm of algorithms). so, i decided to make posters that would
                    convey the essence of the topics we covered in this course. for me, algorithms have always been easiest to learn through visuals. 
                    for that reason, a series of minimalist posters that visually capture the core ideas of the algorithms we studied. each poster distills a concept—whether it's divide and conquer or red black trees—into a clean, striking design. i wanted each piece to resonate not just with its technical meaning, but with the beauty and elegance that algorithms can hold.

                    <b>notes:</b> the lost and found poster collection is a series of visual works based on prose written during
                    2023-2024. the crumpled paper textures mimic posters one may see on the street — some of which is lost to the
                    environment and time. each poster aims to convey the various emotions of the author, as well as the subject.
                    i think memories are also easily lost to time, but eventually finding the precious ones are really important 
                    to me.

                <b>notes:</b> bringing whimsicality and fun into functional designs is a goal of mine. behind the design of mementos lies
                a simple idea: a digital space for physical things. as a collector of various trinkets and scraps, i find joy in what physical
                designs can hold. starting from an initial figma design, i decided to further develop mementos into a react app, leveraging 
                my skills in design and computer science to bring my vision to life. my react project then extended into an exploration of ui/ux 
                design that spans across different languages, specifically english and japanese.

                    wrapped campaign, i created my own "2023 wrapped in media." this project reflects on the moments that 
                    defined my year, capturing everything from personal experiences to the music that accompanied them. claude 
                    monet's impressionist works form the backdrop of my 2023 wrapped, with their dreamy landscapes echoing my 
                    thoughts on the year—nostalgic and contemplative.
