        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>
            Through an intensive 10-week project as part of CS 147: Introduction to Human-Computer Interaction Design, 
            our team was driven to explore solutions under the studio theme "Technology for Mental Health."
        </p>
        <p>
            Planet is a mobile app that reimagines social connectivity by providing a real-time, visual representation of friends' emotions and statuses. 
            Whether someone is open to hanging out or could use a supportive gesture, the app makes reaching out effortless and natural. 
            Rooted in the principles of rapid prototyping, cognitive design, and iterative user feedback, Planet fosters a community 
            where building connections feels intuitive and supportive.

        <p>
            As part of our final project, we created a website to showcase our app and deliverables. 
            I served as the web developer and designer for the Planet website, ensuring that our design 
            values were thoughtfully incorporated throughout. This site earned the "Best Website" award at 
            the CS 147 Final Expo. To explore our design process in detail, click <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs147/projects/Technology-for-Mental-Health/Planet/"

        <h1>Needfinding</h1>
        <p>
            To understand the mental health challenges faced by university students, we conducted four in-depth interviews focused on stressors like academics, extracurriculars, and work-life balance. While we initially planned to address burnout and motivation in relation to our studio theme of Technology for Mental Health, we found that concerns regarding maintaining friendships and relationships were the most recurring themes. Thus, designing for emotional transparency and inclusivity shaped Planet’s core features and values.

        <h1>POV Statements</h1>
        <p>
            After completing the needfinding process, we transitioned to defining actionable problem statements through the creation of Points of View (POVs). By synthesizing the insights gathered from our interviews and empathy maps, we articulated POVs that captured the needs and challenges of our users, ensuring our problem space was well-defined. This process allowed us to reframe our design challenge into clear, meaningful statements, setting the stage for ideation. Below are our top 3 POVs.

        <h1>Low-Fidelity Prototyping</h1>
        <p>
            Moving from sketches to paper prototypes, we tested our three core tasks: setting an emotional status, 
            scheduling a hangout, and organizing friends into "galaxies." Users loved the galaxy grouping and Google Calendar 
            integration but found some icons unclear and dropdowns clunky. Feedback from this stage informed major navigation 
            and workflow improvements.

            In our Figma prototype, we introduced a cohesive purple palette, refined iconography, and embraced our planet branding 
            to make the interface more intuitive and inviting. Testing with peers surfaced 42 heuristic violations, leading to 
            fixes such as adding labels under planets, standardizing sizes, and redesigning the calendar for clarity.
