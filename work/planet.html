        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>
            Through an intensive 10-week project as part of CS 147: Introduction to Human-Computer Interaction Design, 
            our team was driven to explore solutions under the studio theme "Technology for Mental Health."
        </p>
        <p>
            Planet is a mobile app that reimagines social connectivity by providing a real-time, visual representation of friends' emotions and statuses. 
            Whether someone is open to hanging out or could use a supportive gesture, the app makes reaching out effortless and natural. 
            Rooted in the principles of rapid prototyping, cognitive design, and iterative user feedback, Planet fosters a community 
            where building connections feels intuitive and supportive.

            As part of our final project, we created a website to showcase our app and deliverables. 
            I served as the web developer and designer for the Planet website, ensuring that our design 
            values were thoughtfully incorporated throughout. This site earned the "Best Website" award at

        <h1>Needfinding</h1>
        <p>
            To understand the mental health challenges faced by university students, we conducted four in-depth interviews focused on stressors like academics, extracurriculars, and work-life balance. While we initially planned to address burnout and motivation in relation to our studio theme of Technology for Mental Health, we found that concerns regarding maintaining friendships and relationships were the most recurring themes. Thus, designing for emotional transparency and inclusivity shaped Planet‚Äôs core features and values.

        <h1>POV Statements</h1>
        <p>
            After completing the needfinding process, we transitioned to defining actionable problem statements through the creation of Points of View (POVs). By synthesizing the insights gathered from our interviews and empathy maps, we articulated POVs that captured the needs and challenges of our users, ensuring our problem space was well-defined. This process allowed us to reframe our design challenge into clear, meaningful statements, setting the stage for ideation. Below are our top 3 POVs.

        <h1>Experience Prototypes</h1>
        <p>
          Our experience prototypes allowed us to quickly test assumptions behind our top ideas in lightweight, real-world ways. 
          By simulating how students might share emotional updates, plan hangouts, or reconnect with old acquaintances, 
          we validated which concepts felt natural, uncovered usability challenges, and identified the solutions with the strongest potential to carry forward into Planet‚Äôs design.

              Planet was presented at the CS 147 Final Expo, where it was recognized with the award for
              Best Website. Our project demonstrated the potential of combining social connectivity with
              mental health support, showing that small, low-effort interactions can make it easier to maintain
              strong friendships and foster community.

              Personally, this project taught me the importance of iterative user testing, as well as how low-fidelity and medium-fidelity prototypes can shape and validate early design decisions. I strengthened my skills in interaction design, visual hierarchy, and crafting intuitive user flows while learning to balance user needs with project scope in a fast-paced 10-week timeline. Most importantly, I saw how thoughtful design can directly impact well-being by creating tools that help people feel more seen, supported, and connected.
